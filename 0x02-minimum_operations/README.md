# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Introduction
In this project, we tackle the problem of determining the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a certain number of 'H' characters in a text file. The text editor used for this file can only perform two operations: **Copy All** and **Paste**.

## Problem Statement
Given a number `n`, the goal is to write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations required to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters in the file.

## Prototype
```python
def minOperations(n):
    pass
