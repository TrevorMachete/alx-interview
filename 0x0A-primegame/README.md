# 0x0A. Prime Game
## Description
Maria and Ben are playing a game with a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n. They take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, this project determines the winner of each game.
